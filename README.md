#Decision-tree-Project-from-Scratch Using IRIS DATAset

For Iris dataset your task is to print steps for every split in the decision tree.

Your Project is divided in 2 parts -
1. Print the Decision tree steps as specified in the example below. This is of 80 marks in total.
2. Decision Tree Implementation:  Building actual decision tree for the dataset and then printing it. This is of 20 marks.

Dataset: Iris dataset.

Implementation: Consider the decision tree for OR below:

Example:->
Implementation: Consider the decision tree for OR below:

  Expected Output:
  Level  0
  Count of  0(False)  =  1
  Count of  1(True)  =  3
  Current Entropy  is =  0.811278124459
  Splitting on feature  X1  with gain ratio  0.311278124459

  Level  1
  Count of  0  =  1
  Count of  1  =  1
  Current Entropy is =  1.0
  Splitting on feature  X2  with gain ratio  1.0

  Level  2
  Count of  0  =  1
  Current Entropy  is =  0.0
  Reached leaf Node

  Level  2
  Count of  1  =  1
  Current Entropy  is =  0.0
  Reached leaf Node

  Level  1
  Count of  1  =  2
  Current Entropy  is =  0.0
  Reached leaf Node
